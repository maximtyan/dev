# About this blog

Hello, my name is Maxim. I work at Konkuk University in Korea. In this blog want to save my notes that may be useful to others. I plan to write this blog using informal language so readers can feel more comfortable here.

You may find a more serious version of me
[here](https://maximtyan.github.io/cv/)
and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximtyan/). I will not share
my contact information, but it is not difficult to find it online.

I will write about aircraft design, optimization, software development,
project management and other interesting (I hope) topics.
